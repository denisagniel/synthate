Here, we document all candidate estimators we will use in building synthetic causal estimators. For the most part, we write the estimators in the form 
\begin{align*}
\sumin \omega_i y_i,
\end{align*}
where $\omega_i$ is a weight function that can in general depend on all the data. Let $d_i$ be the treatment indicator, and let $x_i$ denote covariates. We will denote the propensity score as $e_i$ and the prognostic score as $g_i$
