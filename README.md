synthate package: Synthetic estimators for the average treatment effect
=======================================================================

This package comprises a suite of tools to simulate various data-generating processes. Its purpose is to check the operating characteristics of various causal estimators and to optimally combine them.

Installation
------------

The `synthate` package can currently be obtained from GitLab: <https://code.rand.org/agniel-projects/personal-packages/synthate> or from GitHub at <https://github.com/denisagniel/synthate>. It may be downloaded by running

``` r
devtools::install_github('denisagniel/synthate')
```

Overview
--------

There are three main features of `synthate`:

-   Simulating data
-   Causal estimation
-   Combining estimators

### Simulating data

There are currently seven DGPs derived from six different papers to choose from:
