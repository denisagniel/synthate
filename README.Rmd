# synthate package: Synthetic estimators for the average treatment effect

This package comprises a suite of tools to simulate various data-generating processes. Its purpose is to check the operating characteristics of various causal estimators and to optimally combine them.

## Installation

The `synthate` package can currently be obtained from GitLab: https://code.rand.org/agniel-projects/personal-packages/synthate or from GitHub at https://github.com/denisagniel/synthate. It may be downloaded by running

```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github('denisagniel/synthate')
```

## Overview

There are three main features of `synthate`:

- Simulating data
- Causal estimation
- Combining estimators

### Simulating data

There are currently seven DGPs derived from six different papers to choose from:
